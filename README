#+TITLE: Techela in a flask

Techela in a flask is an application for using Jupyter notebooks in a course.

There is one command, techela, which launches the flask app for the course and opens it in a browser. This app lists all course lectures, and assignments, and provides the functionality required to download and submit assignments. 

Students complete assignments as IPython notebooks. The app submits the  assignments by email using an authenticated server. The assignments are automatically uploaded to a folder on Box.com. Instructors and TAs then the assignments, add feedback and grades to them, and finally return them to the students by email.

This package is currently only usable at CMU without significant modification.
