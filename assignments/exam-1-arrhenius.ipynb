A typical temperature dependence is given by the Arrhenius equation: $k = k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_A}{R T}\\right)$ where $k_0$ is called the pre-exponential factor, and $E_A$ is called the activation energy. They are both parameters that can be fitted to experimental data. Typically this is done be measuring the rate as a function of temperature, and deriving the $k$ value for each temperature.\n\nThe following data was obtained for the thermal cracking of ethane as a function of temperature. Use this data to solve the following problems."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\nT = np.array([702, 725, 734, 754, 773, 789, 803, 810, 827, 837])  # °C\nk = np.array([0.15, 0.273, 0.33, 0.595, 0.923, 1.492, 2.138, 2.718, 4.137, 4.665]) # 1/s"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# What is the reaction order?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Explain how you know."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Determine $k_0$ and $E_A$ with confidence intervals (do not forget the units!)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Use the best method possible and discuss what your results mean."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Estimate $k$ at 1000 °C."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"exam-1-arrhenius","POINTS":"4","CATEGORY":"exam1","RUBRIC":"default","DUEDATE":"2017-03-23 09:00:00","GRADER":"John"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
