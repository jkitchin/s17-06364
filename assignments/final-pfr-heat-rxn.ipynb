You have to work alone on this problem. You are free to consult the book, your notes, the lecture notes, your homeworks and the posted solutions.</b>\n\nYou are studying the reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$. Unfortunately, you don't know what the heat of reaction is. You design an experiment where an equimolar mixture of $A$ and $B$ is fed at 723K, 1 atm and a volumetric flow of 20 L/s to an adiabatic PFR with a volume of 1000 Liters. The rate constant is known to be $k = 10^{8} \\exp(-Ea/(R T)$ L/mol/s, with $Ea=29000$ cal/mol and T in K. You observed that the exit temperature was about 834 K and an exit conversion of about 0.18 was achieved. What is the heat of reaction? Comment on whether your answer makes sense to you.\n\nAdditional information:\n\n-   CpA = 38  # cal/mol/K\n-   CpB = 20  # cal/mol/K\n-   CpC = 60  # cal/mol/K"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"final-pfr-heat-rxn","POINTS":"3","CATEGORY":"final","RUBRIC":"default","DUEDATE":"2017-05-10 08:30","GRADER":"John"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
