The reaction $A \rightarrow B$ is to be carried out in a flow reactor to achieve 99% conversions. In the next sections, compute and compare the volumes of a CSTR and PFR for each scenario. In each case the entering volumetric flow is 10 L/hr and the inlet concentration is 0.5 M in A.

* Zeroth order rate law

Assume that $-r_A = k$ with $k = 0.05$ mol/L/hr.

** CSTR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

** PFR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

* First order rate law

Assume that $-r_A = k C_A$ with $k=0.0001$ 1/s.


** CSTR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

** PFR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC


* Second order rate law

Assume that $-r_A = k C_A^2$ with $k=3$ L/mol/hr.


** CSTR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

** PFR
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

* Discuss the differences in volume for the different reactors
Explain why there are, or are not differences, and why the they are different between the different rate laws.
