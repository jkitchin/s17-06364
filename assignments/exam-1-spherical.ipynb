In these schematics, there is a catalyst bed in the tan shaded area.\n\n![img](//raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/master/assignments/screenshots/spherical-reactor.png)\n\nThe ammonia decomposition reaction $2NH_3 \\rightarrow  N_2 + 3 H_2$ was run in these reactors. In both cases the inlet pressure was 2000 kPa, and a conversion of 0.81 was achieved with an exit pressure of 1980 kPa in the spherical reactor. The same reaction was run in a tubular packed bed reactor, with the same inlet conditions, the same mass of catalyst, and the same kind of catalyst, but conversion was only 0.71, and the exit pressure was 308 kPa.\n\nExplain why the conversion is higher in the spherical reactor. Be as quantitative as you can, and use equations in your explanation. It is not necessary to solve the equations, but it should be clear from the math what you are communicating."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"exam-1-spherical","POINTS":"3","CATEGORY":"exam1","RUBRIC":"default","DUEDATE":"2017-03-23 09:00:00","GRADER":"John"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
