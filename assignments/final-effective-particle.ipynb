The effective diffusivity of the reactant in the particles is known to be 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/s.\n\nYour colleague is concerned the small pellets will cause an excessive pressure drop and suggests that larger pellets would be better. Another colleague thinks larger particles would be worse because a preliminary experiment with larger pellets showed a lower reaction rate, which suggested that the rate might be mass transfer limited.\n\nEstimate the effectiveness factor for the 6 mm particles and use that to determine if the observed rate is limited by diffusion."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"final-effective-particle","POINTS":"3","CATEGORY":"final","RUBRIC":"default","DUEDATE":"2017-05-10 08:30:00","GRADER":"John"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
