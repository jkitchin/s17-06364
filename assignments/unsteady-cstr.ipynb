Mathematically, this led to an algebraic equation. The full mole balance is:\n\n $\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = F_{A0} - F_A + r_A V$ \n\nwhich resembles the batch reactor, but with flows. \n\nFor the reaction  $A \\rightarrow B$ , with  $-r_A = k C_A^2$ and  $k=3$ L/mol/hr in a CSTR with a volume of 66,000 L, with an inlet volumetric flow of 10 L/hr, and an inlet concentration of 0.5 M in A, plot the time dependent concentration of A in the reactor until it reaches steady state. You can assume that  $N_A(t=0) = 0$ for the initial condition. Discuss how long it takes for the reactor to approximately reach steady state (you should say what you mean by steady state, and how you determined the time to reach it).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"unsteady-cstr","POINTS":"3","DUEDATE":"2017-02-01 23:59:59","CATEGORY":"homework","RUBRIC":"default"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
