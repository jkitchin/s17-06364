A first order reaction occurs in the reactor. The rate constant is not known, but it is known that after a long time a steady state conversion of 60% is observed. How long did it take to reach 99% of the steady state conversion?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"final-cstr-startup","POINTS":"3","CATEGORY":"final","RUBRIC":"default","DUEDATE":"2017-05-10 08:30","GRADER":"John"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
