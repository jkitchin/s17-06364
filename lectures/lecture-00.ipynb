My office is in Doherty Hall A207F.\n\nWe have three TAs:\n\n1.  Elif Erdinc\n2.  Daniel Lee\n3.  David Molina Thierry\n\n\n# Slack and Email\n\nI will use Slack for class announcements. You should use it to ask questions outside of class. It would be a good way for me to get to know you.\n\nYou can access Slack via website, desktop app, and phone app. Let's make it work!\n\n\n# The course website\n\nThe course website is it at [http://bit.ly/s17-06364>](http://bit.ly/s17-06364>)in GitHUB.\n\nThe syllabus: [https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/blob/master/syllabus.org](https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/blob/master/syllabus.org)\n\nYou can see the lecture notes here: [https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/tree/master/lectures>](https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/tree/master/lectures>)and the course schedule: [https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/blob/master/course-schedule.org](https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/blob/master/course-schedule.org)\n\nAssignments will be located here: [https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/tree/master/assignments](https://github.com/jkitchin/s17-06364/tree/master/assignments). I will provide you with directions on how to use them when it is time.\n\n\n# Assignments\n\nAll assignments must be turned in to the Box email address: submiss.uj1v37qz3m0gpzsu@u.box.com. Please do not send them to me directly.\n\nAll assignments must turned in as a Jupyter notebook. I recommend you install Anaconda Python for this.\n\nEvery assignment will have a label, and it must be named by this scheme: andrewid-label.ipynb in all lower-case letters. Failure to follow those *simple* instructions will mean your assignment will not be graded.\n\nAssignments are due by 11:59:59pm on the due date. Assignments submitted after we have collected it may not get graded.\n\nGraded homeworks will be returned to you by email.\n\nYour homeworks should be neat, and organized. You must put narrative text describing what you are doing, and what your results mean. **I do not want to see homeworks containing only code!**\n\n\n# Python\n\nI will use Python exclusively in class, every day. Python is free, and better than anything else for what we will do in this class. I have used it in research for more than a decade.\n\nSee [http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/>](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/>)\n\nIt is not hard. You will see it a lot.\n\nIf you do not like it, you can use Matlab. You have to publish your work to a PDF to turn it in though.\n\n\n# The Jupyter notebook\n\nThe Jupyter notebook is a browser based tool to write and run Python code. You can integrate narrative text, equations, and images with your code.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Hello class"}],"source":["print('Hello class')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["[./lecture-01.ipynb](./lecture-01.ipynb)\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{"TITLE":"Introduction to 06-364","AUTHOR":"John Kitchin"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
