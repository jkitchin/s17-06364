    "## Ch. 3.2.3 Reversible reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversible reactions are written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$aA + bB \\rightleftharpoons cC + dD$. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means the reaction can go forward and backward, and there is a forward rate and backwards rate, as well as a net rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these reactions are at steady state, in a constant volume system with no flows, we say they are at equilibrium. The concentrations at equilibrium are related to the equilibrium constant $K_C$ according to this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_C = \\frac{C_{C,eq}^c C_{D,eq}^d}{C_{A,eq}^a C_{B,eq}^b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For specificity consider $2B \\rightleftharpoons D + H$\n",
    "\n",
    "We would write the forward reaction rate law as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-r_{B,forward} = k_B C_B^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the reverse rate law as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{B,reverse} = k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n",
    "\n",
    "The net rate of consumption is the sum of these two reactions (B is consumed in the forward reaction, and produced in the backwards reaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_B = -k_B C_B^2 + k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note we have three concentrations in this rate law! They are related by stoichiometry, and later we will see how to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "At equilibrium, we have that the net rate must be zero (or else the concentrations will be changing). So:\n",
    "\n",
    "$k_B C_B^2 = k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's rewrite that as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{k_B}{k_{-B}} = \\frac{C_D C_H}{C_B^2} = K_C = \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{rxn}}{R T})$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important connection between thermodynamics and kinetics here: *They must be consistent!* Of the three quantities $k_B$, $k_{-B}$ and $K_C$, only two are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an alternative way to write this rate law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-r_B = k_B \\left(C_B^2 - \\frac{C_D C_H}{K_C}\\right)$.\n",

    "Let's write the reaction as $ A + B \\rightleftharpoons C + D$.\n",
    "\n",

    "It should strike you as interesting that you can get a higher conversion in the flow system for this reaction! That happens because the system is open and operates at *constant pressure*. In contrast to the batch reactor which is closed and operates at *constant volume*. In the batch reactor the pressure increases, and LeChatelier's principle pushes this reaction towards reactants since there are more moles of products than for reactants.\n",
