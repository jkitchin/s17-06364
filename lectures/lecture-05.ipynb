The concentrations at equilibrium are related to the equilibrium constant $K_C$ according to this equation:\n\n$K_C = \\frac{C_{C,eq}^c C_{D,eq}^d}{C_{A,eq}^a C_{B,eq}^b}$\n\nFor specificity consider $2B \\rightleftharpoons D + H$\n\nWe would write the forward reaction rate law as:\n\n$-r_{B,forward} = k_B C_B^2$\n\nand the reverse rate law as:\n\n$r_{B,reverse} = k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n\nThe net rate of consumption is the sum of these two reactions (B is consumed in the forward reaction, and produced in the backwards reaction).\n\n$r_B = -k_B C_B^2 + k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n\nNote we have three concentrations in this rate law! They are related by stoichiometry, and later we will see how to do that. \n\nAt equilibrium, we have that the net rate must be zero (or else the concentrations will be changing). So:\n\n$k_B C_B^2 = k_{-B} C_D C_H$\n\nLet's rewrite that as:\n\n$\\frac{k_B}{k_{-B}} = \\frac{C_D C_H}{C_B^2} = K_C = \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{rxn}}{R T})$\n\nThere is an important connection between thermodynamics and kinetics here: *They must be consistent!* Of the three quantities $k_B$, $k_{-B}$ and $K_C$, only two are independent of each other.\n\nThis leads to an alternative way to write this rate law:\n\n$-r_B = k_B \\left(C_B^2 - \\frac{C_D C_H}{K_C}\\right)$.\n\nYou choose which one to use based on the information given. \n\n\n## An example with the water gas shift reaction\n\nThe WGS reaction is $CO + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H2$. It is used to produce hydrogen from water. The reaction is exothermic, with $\\Delta G_{rxn}=730$ cal/mol CO.\n\nLet's write the reaction as $ A + B \\rightleftharpoons C + D$.\n\nIf we start out with 5 atm of water vapor and 5 atm of CO at 1000K, estimate the equilibrium composition.\n\nTo do this we need to compute the equilibrium constant.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Kc = 0.69"}],"source":["G = 730  # cal/mol\nT = 1000 # K\nR1 = 1.987 # cal / mol / K\n\nimport numpy as np\nKc = np.exp(-G / (R1 * T))\n\nprint('Kc = {:1.2f}'.format(Kc))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Kc is less than one, so we expect there to be slightly more reactants than products at equilibrium.\n\nNext, we know that $K_C = \\frac{C_{C,eq} C_{D,eq}}{C_{A,eq} C_{B,eq}}$ but we do not know the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nHowever, if we know the conversion, we can compute the concentrations. For example, if the conversion is $X$ then $C_A = C_{A0} (1 - X)$. The amount of A that has reacted is simply $C_{A0} X$. So, by stoichiometry, we know that:\n\n$C_B = C_{B0} - C_{A0}X$\n\n$C_C = C_{C0} + C_{A0}X$\n\n$C_D = C_{D0} + C_{A0}X$\n\nNow, we have all the concentrations in terms of one unknown, $X$. We just have to plug those values into the $K_C$ equation, and solve it for X. We use fsolve for the solution.

We neglected to determine what the limiting reagent here is. Once $C_B = 0$ the reaction will stop, so in this case it is not possible to achieve 90% conversion of A. In this case, we should have used species B for the basis. Note we still cannot get 90% conversion of A, even for 100% conversion of B.\n\n**Exercise:** Determine the maximum conversion of A that is possible. \n\n\n# Equations for concentration of flow systems\n\nFor a flow system we define concentration as $C_A = F_A / \\nu$. With species A as a basis, we can write $F_A = F_{A0} (1 - X)$, and again we have that the amount of A that has reacted is $F_{A0} X$. \n\nFor a reaction like:\n\n$A + \\frac{b}{a} B \\rightarrow \\frac{c}{a} C + \\frac{d}{a} D$\n\nwe can use stoichiometry to determine how much of each species has reacted or been produced. So, if $F_{A0} X$ is the amount that A has reacted, then:\n\n$b/a F_{A0} X$ is how much B has reacted\n\n$c/a F_{A0} X$ is how much C was produced\n\n$d/a F_{A0} X$ is how much D was produced.\n\nSo, the molar flows of each species is then:\n\n$F_A = F_{A0} - F_{A0} X = F_{A0} (1 - X)$\n\n$F_B = F_{B0} - \\frac{b}{a} F_{A0} X$\n\n$F_C = F_{C0} + \\frac{c}{a} F_{A0} X$\n\n$F_D = F_{D0} + \\frac{d}{a} F_{A0} X$\n\nThe book tries to \"simplify\" these equations with variables like $\\Theta_B = \\frac{F_{B0}}{F_{A0}}$. This does not make sense in my opinion. You will not see me do it. I think it is easier to use the molar flows directly in code. Decide for yourself below.\n\nFor liquid systems, the volumetric flow is usually constant (assuming no density change from the reaction), so we just divide the molar flows by the volumetric flows to get the concentrations: $C_A = F_A / \\nu$.\n\nFor gas systems, it is more complicated; the volumetric flow is only constant if there is no change in the number of moles in the reaction mixture. Recall that the ideal gas law is $P V = n R T$ or for a flow system: $P \\nu = F R T$. If $F$ (the total molar flow) changes due to reactions, then the volumetric flow will change too.\n\nFor now, let's consider an isobaric (constant P) and isothermal (constant T) situation with ideal gases. At the entrance of a reactor we have:\n\n$P \\nu_0 = F_{T0} R T$\n\nSomewhere else in the reactor we might have:\n\n$P \\nu = F_T R T$.\n\nWe can take the ratio of these equations to yield:\n\n$\\nu = \\nu_0 \\frac{F_T}{F_{T0}}$ \n\nwhere $F_{T0}$ is the total inlet molar flow, and $F_T$ is the molar flow at the point of interest. \n\nSometimes, the molar flow does not change, for example in the reaction $A \\rightarrow B$, we have a mole of reactants producing a mole of products, and the total moles is always constant.\n\nFor $A + B \\rightarrow C$, however, two moles of reactants produce one mole of products, so  the molar flow decreases with conversion, and thus the volumetric flow will decrease with conversion.\n\nIn contrast, $A \\rightarrow 2B$, has one mole of reactant producing two moles of product, so the total molar flow increases and the volumetric flow increases with conversion.\n\nIn the book they define $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$. We will not be using those. It is easier to just compute the total molar flows.\n\n\n## An example to highlight the difference between constant volume and flow systems\n\n\n### A constant volume batch reactor\n\nThe reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons 2B$ has an equilibrium constant of $K_C = 0.1$ mol/L at 340K.
