There could be scenarios with orders of magnitude difference in the values, e.g. 1M vs 0.01M. It is difficult to assess whether an answer is reasonable like this. It is nicer to think about the questions in a different way:\n\n-   What fraction of reactants have reacted in the reactor?\n-   How large a reactor do we need to convert 90% of the reactants to products?\n\nThe fraction here will be bounded between 0 and 1.\n\n\n## The definition of conversion\n\nFor the reaction  $a A + b B \\rightarrow c C d D$ , we call the little letters the stoichiometric coefficients. We need to specify a species as the *basis* for defining conversion, and make sure the stoichiometric coefficient on that species is 1. Let's choose A as the basis, and normalize the reaction like this:\n\n $A + \\frac{b}{a} B \\rightarrow \\frac{c}{a} C \\frac{d}{a}$ \n\nNow, we define the conversion:\n\n $X_A = \\frac{\\textrm{Moles of A reacted}}{\\textrm{Moles of A fed}}$ \n\nThe maximum this conversion can be is 1, if all the moles of A fed are reacted. For a single reaction, we often drop the subscript and just use  $X$ .\n\nFor a batch reactor, the moles of A fed is just the initial moles of A in the reactor  $N_{A0}$ . The number of moles that have reacted is the *difference* between the number of moles initially in the reactor, and the moles currently in the reactor, i.e.  $N_{A0} - N_A$ .\n\nSo:\n\n $X = \\frac{N_{A0}-N_A}{N_{A0}}$ \n\nor, to find the number of moles of A in the reactor at some conversion:\n\n $N_A = N_{A0}(1-X)$ \n\n\n## Conversion in the batch reactor Ch 2.2\n\nRecall the mole balance on the batch reactor is:\n\n $\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = r_A V$ \n\nIf you substitute the expression for  $N_A$ in terms of  $X$ , we can convert this equation to:\n\n $\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{-r_A V}{N_{A0}}$ \n\n\n### Find the time to achieve 99% conversion\n\nIf a first order reaction occurs in a constant volume batch reactor with a rate constant of 0.23 1/min, how long does it take to reach a conversion of 99%?\n\nThis means:   $-r_A = k C_A$ . Since we have constant volume, we can write  $C_A = C_{A0}(1 - X)$ . The equation we have to solve becomes:\n\n $\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{-k C_{A0}(1 - X)}{C_{A0}}$ \n\nor, after canceling the initial concentrations, and separating the equation we get:\n\n $t = \\int_0^{0.99}\\frac{1}{k} \\frac{dX}{1-X}$ \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"It takes 20.02 minutes to reach a conversion of 0.99."}],"source":["from scipy.integrate import quad\n\nk = 0.23  # 1/min\n\ndef integrand(X):\n    return 1 / k * 1 / (1 - X)\n\nX1 = 0\nX2 = 0.99\nans, err = quad(integrand, X1, X2)\n\nprint('It takes {:1.2f} minutes to reach a conversion of {}.'.format(ans, X2))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Suppose we want to explore how the time varies with conversion.

Why? The reactor is well-mixed, so the rate at the exit is the same as the rate in the reactor. This particular example only requires some evaluation. Suppose we know  $F_{A0} = 3$ mol/min, with a volumetric flow of two L/min. The reaction is  $A \\rightarrow B$ , with a rate law of  $-r_A = k C_A^2$ ( $k = 0.1$ L/mol/min).
