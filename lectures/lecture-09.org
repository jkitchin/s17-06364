** Solving algebraic equations

Solve the equation $x^2 = 3$ for $x$.

This is an algebraic equation that is nonlinear in $x$. So, we use fsolve. To do that we need to define a function that will be equal to zero at the solution. We get that with this equation:

$0 = 3 - x^2$

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
def objective(x):
    return 3 - x**2
#+END_SRC

We need to provide a guess for fsolve. An easy way to get a guess is to graph the function.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

X = np.linspace(0, 3)
Y = objective(X)

plt.plot(X, Y)
#+END_SRC

You should see in this graph that the objective function passes through zero around 1.7. We use that to make a guess in fsolve.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

ans, = fsolve(objective, 1.7)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

** Solving an integral

Evaluate the integral: $\int_0^\pi sin(x) dx$. This is a definite integral so we use quad.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
from scipy.integrate import quad

def integrand(x):
    return np.sin(x)

ans, err = quad(integrand, 0, np.pi)

print(ans)
#+END_SRC
